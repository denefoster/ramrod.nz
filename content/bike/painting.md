And some downtime waiting for parts, I got tired of looking at the rattlecan silver tank and green tail. Cue two days of sanding, wire wheel brushing, grinding, and a dab of bondo !

Still have to choose a colour (and go through 2-3 more coats of primer and even more sanding =\) but we're on the way !
