Christmas came late for Team Car Ramrod and because i had too much free time and money, uh huh.

Running a KRD barrel I'd originally thought was 75/80 and had a running parts list to convert back to a 50;

Heyo, already 50. And badass looking to boot.

Thankfully I've already got a good home for it;

Which is mostly setup. Has slicks, decent rear sets, brakes, etc.

Thus begins the work of readying a new bike, the current list of parts needed:

 * intake manifold

 * 428 front sprocket

 * radiator hoses

 * silencer

And the list of parts acquired but need fitting:

 * Fenix kx250 radiator

 * ex250 front master cylinder

 * 24mm Koso

 * stock pipe (for now)

 * and well, the motor.

Lots of work to do !
