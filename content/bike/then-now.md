This was our first view of the bike when picking it up:

It wasn't all that pretty, and wasn't at all rideable, but the hard work of making a TF125 fit had been done, so a good place to start

And man look at it now,

I'd list all the things replaced/rebuilt, but the list of what's the same is *much* smaller:

 * the frame
 * the rims
 * the rear caliper
 * clutch lever
 * expansion header
 * gas tank

Highlights of new bits:

 * new engine
 * forks
 * rear sets
 * shift linkage
 * front rotor, caliper, master
 * rear master
 * frame/axle sliders and er, axles
 * silencer
 * tail/seat
 * shmancy paint job

And on the plus side, I have lots of new tools now !
