Finally have the troika of a new set of slicks, wheels they'll fit on, and time to shove them onto the bike. Battleax V02s huzzah !

I have a set of FZR400 1WG wheels, 3.50x17 rear, and 2.50x17 front. The rear shouldn't be an issue, but the front is made for a 15mm axle, and mine is 12. There does exist a set of bearings, 6401-2RS which are 12x42x13, which would make things just work.. alas I can't seem to actually buy them.

Scratch that. Just fit the front 90/58 onto the original wheel, a 2.15x17. Threw a new Brembo disc I had laying around on while the wheel was off and she's lookin' pretty (in purple, not pink).

And the rear, she'll just fit right ?

Unpack my stupidly expensive new cush rubbers, pop them on, fit new sprocket carrier, check against current chain. Problem #1. Wrong pitch.

Old sprocket carrier back on and try again.

Slot the wheel on, problem #2. The previous set of spacers were ~4mm too wide with the new rim. This could be an issue, no tools to machine them down, and it's race day tomorrow. So root around in the ole toolbox, fiddle with every random wheel I've got laying around and come up with a set of dust cover + press fit spacer that looks about right. Onwards and upwards!

Straight enough for buckets !

Doesn't even bind up when tightening the rear axle. Improvement!

Half a wide wheel conversion done before 10am on a Saturday and now ready to race in the forecasted torrential rain !
