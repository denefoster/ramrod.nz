It's true what they say, there ain't no replacement for displacement.. so with that in mind, i started building a 50.

Yepppp, 50 whopping cubic centimeters. The really sad thing though, is this probably puts out more power than my 125cc, and weighs heaps less.

It all started when I had the great idea to build an electric bike. Sketchy had a VJ21 frame kickin' around for cheap, and it was more or less setup.

Just needed front brakes, and threw a Ninja 250 M/C on there and that was sorted.

Built up a BOM for the electric project and sent it off for a quote, and it came back as $10,000 big ones (US big ones even !). Wat. Clearly I need to go back to the drawing board.

So trawling trademe as one does, lo, there was a pair of AM6s for sale, cheap with a buy now. Buy now indeed. I'd been after one for awhile anyhow, so VJ21/AM6 it is !

That left the problem of actually putting the motor in the frame, Sketchy had done up a subframe for some MX85 testing, looked like that might work, so borrowed a MIG from a friend and off a welding I went. That lasted about 5minutes, I can't weld for shit, so on the horn to Cycleworks and he was keen to git er done.

In the meantime, a 428 sprocket, and intake manifold for a 24mm carb came from somewhere in Eastern Europe.

Picked up the bike this morning, and he's done a bang-up job as usual

That left the radiator, and shift linkage, and to make it actually run.

Since we're in New Zealand, I decided to go all Britten and do an underseat radiator.

That's enough work for today, so dressed her all up ready for some carb tuning on the weekend to get it ready for club day on Sunday
