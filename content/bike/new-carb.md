Both tf125s I've got came with some piece of horseshit vm24, which was a pain to start (it broke two drills so far!) and one plain [fell apart]({filename}/race/race-day-3.md)

I knew I'd need a new carb at some point anyhow, and finally was able to CAD up the part I'd need to adapt the more common spigot mount to the flange on the tf125 intake side. Thank to Dean P for the CAD help !

And the result.

totally badass, and super kudos to [Farra Engineering](http://www.farra.co.nz), they'll get any more work I need done.

And a new TM24 ordered from [MikuniOZ](http://www.mikunioz.com/), they were great to deal with.


Drill out the stud holes in the manifold, get some 32mm vinyl hose of dubious gasoline resistance and we're ready to fire it up.

Grab a new cheap 700w 240v drill, since push starting is for suckers. wham! Starts first hit and my rigged up second throttle kinda falls over revving like nobody's business. And as usual, a gob of black oily goo fires out the exhaust and coats most things in the garage. But hey, it starts easy, revs nice and that's all that matters.

Hopefully the weather stays nice this week and I can do some full-tilt runs under load and see how the stock jetting is, and be ready for racing in a week or so !
