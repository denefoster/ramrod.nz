Summary: The first race... well, it went

So we passed scrutineering with the bike as we got it more or less, no tune on the engine, bits replaced with stock or similar to get it to a point where it's ridable.. and well, it sucked.

The first three races the primary coil was loose, limiting engine to 3-4k rpm, making a whopping 4BHP or so.

That coupled with a horrid geometry left me not really able to get off the bike, so scraping pegs rather than making decent turns and then no real power out of corners.

Fixed the coil, and it made a few more revs, and a tiny bit more power, but still incredibly lacking.

So time to redo all the things !

The list so far:

 * rebuild forks

 * redo rear sets

 * redo front-end geometry

 * new seat

 * rebuild front caliper

 * rebuild front master cylinder

 * measure out exhaust timings and see if we can't improve power a bit

Mostly waiting on brake parts now, and the rest is just blood, sweat and beers.
