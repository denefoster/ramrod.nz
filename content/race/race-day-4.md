Pretty keen to test out the new carb on the track, and see how my completely seat of the pants jetting would be, we got ready for race day nice and early. Up at 6, hose myself off, throw crap in the car and off we went bike in tow.

After the driver's briefing, was a bit nervous, as the previous carb made the bike impossible to start, mostly making me look like a tool running up and down the hill to try and make it to the first practice. This time, no problems whatsoever. Fired right up in the pits after a 1m push start. Sweet.

First practice, took it a bit easy, trying to get a feel for the fueling and it seemed to survive. Thought about doing the right thing and a plug chop run, but meh.. felt okay so just ran as normal

Looked alright ! Back to the pits and for once, nothing to do until race #1.

Line up in the pits for race #1 and time to get my game face on.

Head out of the pits feeling pretty good, and off we go !

This! This is what a race should be like. Bike felt *good* for the first time. Starting to getting a feel for the track, and the bike was running acceptably. And a second place (behind an a-grader even) finish to top it off. Best race of the day. This racing thing ain't so bad.

Next race, not sure if it's because I was a bit tired, but just was crap. Back stepped out a few times, got scooped by the mini-moto and an fxr. Bike still ran well enough though.

Third race, back to feeling pretty good on the track. Still got whooped by the same mini and fxr, and my legs are starting to feel the burn. Got the rear back in line (just hang off more they say, it'll be fine they say.. and it is !)

And now it's my body that fails before the bike. Legs are pretty shaky, so decide to pack it up.

Fantastic day, and great crowd to duel with, and for once I'm not heading home in shame !

Next month is the endurance race, so need to eat less pies for the next month and do more running to make sure I can handle 45mins.
