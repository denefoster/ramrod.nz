So we showed up bright and early for race day #2 with our shiny [new-look], unloaded everything and got setup. After the drivers meeting, went to start the bike and as usual, had a bit of trouble.

So up and down the small hill a few times in leathers and helmet. Man, hard work. Ended up dropping the bike at a standstill, scraping up my palm, and knocking off the gear shift toe bar (important for later!)

After a bit of mucking around, got it running and all seemed well enough
