Summary: The second race... probably worse

So we showed up bright and early for race day #2 with our shiny [new-look](photos/bike/img_5918a.jpg), unloaded everything and got setup. After the drivers meeting, went to start the bike and as usual, had a bit of trouble.

So up and down the small hill a few times in leathers and helmet. Man, hard work. Ended up dropping the bike at a standstill, scraping up my palm, and knocking off the gear shift toe bar (important for later!)

After a bit of mucking around, got it running and all seemed well enough, and the call came out for the next B grade race. Notcing my shift knob was still a bit loose form the tumble I did my best to cut a line, and try to safety wire it on and off to the start line we went !

The on-board race:

Well, the four or so laps I got in before the gear knob fell off and I had to pull in, which is probably a good thing since it turns out one of the engine mount bolts was halfway out, and the now-lower suspension had the pipe scraping on tight lefts.

Engine mount now re-bolted with nylock and both ends safety wire drilled and will work on the suspension over the next week.
