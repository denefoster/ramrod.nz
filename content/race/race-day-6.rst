So after being too afraid to even drive out last month due to the monsoon, this month actually was the enduro, huzzah!

Booked in to race at 3pm, I was up and at'em at the usual time. Figured I'd head out early to see if any of the kart races needed a hand flagging.. all I ended up doing was sitting around eating too many pies.

I did manage to snag a co-rider, so iron man for me, M. would be my partner in crime. Bike is all setup, it was either going to go, or the rear wheel was going to fall off and kill me in a fireball, so nothing to do but wait.

Running a bit late all day, finally came near 4pm and we're up. Leather on, boots done up. Ready. We managed to negotiate 5 practice laps, which I let M. do, since he'd never been on the wee ripper before. He didn't crash.. so, ready to race ! For some reason we decided to do a Le Mans start for the enduro, and after his laps, M. was holding the bike up for me to do the start.


Race 1.. of 1, part 1, cue running:

Not a bad start, the orange devil kicked in first go and we're off. First time on slicks and holy fuck. I reckon it could probably ride upside down, it's ridiculously sticky. Feeling pretty good and getting into a rhythm.

Part 2, it starts to go wrong:

See if you can spot where it started to go wrong. It was looking so promising too, my fastest lap ever (48.5, a full 3 seconds faster than previous efforts). And I started to feel way too hot. Started to make mistakes. And the feel of oncoming vomit was strong. Yay heatstroke. Pulled in about 10 mins earlier than expected and M. did the run up to the gate and took over mid-way through this part.

Part 3:

I mostly just lay on the concrete and tried to drink some water, so didn't watch much here, but M. continued to not crash, and looking at the laptimes was doing pretty awesome for only ever being out once before.

Not crashing continues, times are getting better and better.

Done and done, M. was a champ. We did a total of 57 laps, for 7th place. 22 for me and 35 for M. The bike ran amazingly well, the slicks are un-expletive-believable. Have a few minor ergo tweaks in mind, but she's sharp. Super happy.


So.. bike is good. I suck. First step is a new back protector that's not a full vest. Less heat == more racing. Hopefully the consistency will stick around, hitting mid-48s per lap (previously was 51-52s), need to keep that up for a full 6 races a day.

And lastly, an avid reader asked how the video works, so see another post about `the tech <{filename}/tech/video-tech.md>`_
