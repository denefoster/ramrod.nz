:summary: getting this GPS thing sorted out

I thought this was going to be the endurance race for some reason, so was all ready for a 45min debacle, alas, normal race day it is.

Shame I shoved a full 17L of fuel into the tank.. all the pies I could have eaten and run with 4L and weighed about the same. Oh well.

The bike starts consistently, runs consistently, so this was a day more of figuring out a few more corners and testing cameras. Kinda boring
with nothing to fix (aside from being slow as, but fixing that will come later)

The good news is that I've now got a video + GPS -> sane output pipeline setup.

Race 1:

.. youtube:: DeCJ91FIvoU
    :class: youtube-16x9
    :allowfullscreen: yes
    :seamless: yes

Race 2:

.. youtube:: MCyDUSju-kw
    :class: youtube-16x9
    :allowfullscreen: yes
    :seamless: yes

Race 3:

.. youtube:: Y-uOregYpMw
    :class: youtube-16x9
    :allowfullscreen: yes
    :seamless: yes

Race 4 had a camera mulfunction, but it was a bit shit house anyways.

This months wrenching is pretty much just adapting a set of FZR400 3LN wheels, and hopefully snagging a new set of slicks to shoehorn onto them. Updates to come
when I start that process
