So, another race day and still working on bike problems. Good news is the chassis seems pretty good, the R6 shock doing the business in the back and the front-end rake coping well. First practice run was a wash as she didn't start up. Second practice race was gooooooood. Wasn't last, and almost keeping up with the mostly A groupers.

Engine was running pretty well, and i was doing okay in the mixed A/B group.. now, i say was. During the first points race, lap 5 as I was coming into turn 2 the bike started sputtering, feeling like it was running out of fuel. Shit. Left hand up, ride it out onto the left side of the track to sit and wait till end of the race. Twat I am, running out of fuel I thought.

Back to the pits, and it's lunch time so throw some gas in and forget about it while i eat some chups and enjoy standing around in wet leathers.

Lunch over, race time. First ones out after the rain, so should be fun. Suit up and give the bike a push figuring some fresh fuel would help and... nothing.

Get some help pushing, more nothing. Feck. Flaggers needed so park up the bike and go flag instead of race.

Afterwards decide to just pack it up as things weren't looking good and home I go.

Figuring I should probably sort this out sooner rather than later, off work Tuesday eve.. grab a 500w drill, some lights and some warm bits off to the garage I go. Fart around a bit, making sure fuel is going in, check the plug, replace the plug, crank with giant mains drill, check the plug, replace the plug. Rinse repeat. Fuckit. off with the carb. Oh yeah, studs are stuck in carb and its a huge pain to remove. Bleh. Off it comes anyways. Poke and prod a bit. Aha ! A culprit. Twist throttle, slides goes up, needle jet doesn't move. Huh. Try again. Slide goes up, needle jet stays. wat.

Pop the top, remove throttle cable, spring, washer and the jet needle just kinda fell out. Stupid e-clip nowhere to be found. Fuuuuuuuuh. Find other carb, remove jet needle, transplant e-clip, replace cable, replace washer, re-do up dumb studs. Crank over a few times without the carb and do everything back up.

8pm after a long day, tired of this crap, lights are almost out of juice so one more shot.. finally. Fires up (and im sure spit oil everywhere, but can't see in the dark, lalala). Score one for team failtotroubleshooteffectively !

So im not dumb and didn't run out of fuel at least ! Though I did forget my camera so have no video/metrics/anything from the day except a broken carb.
