So there's this [TSS Red Baron](http://www.redbaron.co.nz/)  King of Kaitoke thing, an actual points series.

Now, I've been racing buckets for a year and a bit, since March 2016, but never for points. Funny how much difference it makes, days when I maybe wouldn't get out of bed I now push myself to get up, getting passed is no longer okay.. gotta get them points. So it's been great, tons of competition, lots of pushing myself to get out there and actually race instead of taking it easy.

First round was pretty horrible, rainy day and I was the lone bike without wets. Had my first crash, and wound up 7th overall. Not bad, but not great, the TF is pretty slow but I can do better.

Second round meant starting far back on the grid, and everybody and their dog was there with mighty FXRs and R15s. I was still kinda off my game from the crash last month and not really feeling it. No knee down, not really pushing. Still, clawed my way back to fourth overall, pretty happy considering the power differentials involved.

Third round and it's on. Force myself to just get back on that horse and ride the shit outta my mighty TF. It's the points right ? Checkers or wreckers. Head out for a tuning run, bike feels.. normal. That's good, not much power as usual, but that means I can really throttle on just about anywhere and rely on the surprisingly excellent handling on the TZR chassis.

Race 1, okay, so I got lucky.. fourth on the grid, third place didn't show up. A few laps in, #36 goes down in the hairpin, #23 follows behind and goes offroading for a bit. Never looking a gift horse in the mouth I was able to avoid the chaos and slip by, first place for me.

Race 2, pole, no pressure ! Except, the TF is terrible off the line. Get passed by #23 and #36 immediately. Takes a couple of laps, and jockying with #23 a few times, but I'm hot on the wheel of #36. Now, 36 is one mean machine and the rider ain't so bad so I'm feeling pretty damned good being able to stay on his rear wheel for the rest of the race. Held first for a glorious few second before being outpowered near the end of the straights. Second place in the end, super happy with that.

Race 3, second on the grid and starts just like the last race, playing catchup. This time #23 had enough of me, and gave me no chance. Third it is, still super happy, both #23 and #36 are great riders and am learning a whole new set of skills planning lines, passes and blocking.

On the whole, first on the day !
