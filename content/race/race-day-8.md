Someone must have thought I was getting a bit too big for my britches, or the universe hates new leathers. The fun day turned into an unmitigated disaster. Or maybe the lack of a blog post from last month.

The result, and cause:

Prior to the image, I was riding along. Suddenly felt the engine sure, and immediately after the rear wheel locked up. Clutched in, thinking it was a standard two stroke failure, newp ! Thankfully, it was horrifically wet out there and rather than high side or similar, it just fish tailed to a stop.

Dragged off to one side and watched the rest of the race go by. A helpful bystander ran out and helped pushed the locked up bike into the pits and could finally have a good look at what happened.

The chain had fallen off, got caught up on the rear sprocket nuts and locked up the rear. Thankfully, no real damage to the swing arm (or me !). A new chain and some new nuts should have it all sorted. And that's my 1 minute of racing for the month. Good effort !

I don't even have video of it =(
