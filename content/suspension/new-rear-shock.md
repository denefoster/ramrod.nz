To replace the slightly tired (and budget) 30 year old rear shock an RJ03 shock was acquired. It's mostly a direct bolt-on, requiring a couple of washers on the top bushing. its 305mm versus the stock at 295mm so the tail sits a bit higher than stock (which is good!) and gives us a lot more knobs to twist in getting the rear happy on the track

The old grody one:
